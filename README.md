#Twitter Sentiment Analysis

The project aims to develop a sentiment analysis tool that analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets related to a specific Twitter handle. It utilizes the Tweepy API, a Python library for accessing the Twitter API, to gather tweets and perform sentiment analysis.

The following steps outline the functionality of the project:

    User Input: The user provides the Twitter handle (username) for which they want to analyze the sentiment of tweets.

    Tweepy API Integration: The project integrates the Tweepy API to access the Twitter API and gather tweets from the specified Twitter handle. It uses the Tweepy library to authenticate and retrieve tweets.

    Sentiment Analysis: The collected tweets are then subjected to sentiment analysis. This involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the sentiment expressed in each tweet.

    Sentiment Classification: Each tweet is classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on its sentiment score. The sentiment score can be derived using various techniques such as rule-based analysis, lexicon-based analysis, or machine learning models.

    Percentage Calculation: The project calculates the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets among the collected data. This provides an overview of the sentiment distribution for the specified Twitter handle.

    Output: Finally, the project displays the percentages of positive, negative, and neutral tweets to the user. This information gives insights into the overall sentiment expressed towards the specified Twitter handle.

By leveraging the Tweepy API and sentiment analysis techniques, this project provides a useful tool to analyze public sentiment on Twitter. It can be utilized for various purposes such as brand monitoring, public opinion analysis, or social media sentiment tracking.
